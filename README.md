# Android Tiers
 Android Tiers aims to add several tiers of sentient android colonists, robots, mechs and other features. In an attempt to vastly extend late-game colonies.

# About this Fork
This fork's main goal is to optimize Android Tiers to the best of my abilities. While some things can't be easily addressed because they are out of my reach (like the HAR dependency), I can still tweak and optimize the code at other places.

Hopefully with this Android Tiers might run smoothly and no longer cause spikes in computation time, it would be too sad to throw it out.
